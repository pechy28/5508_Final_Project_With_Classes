# 5508_Final_Project_With_Classes
Final for DIG 5508 including classes. Does not currently work, please view the version without classes.


My final project for DIG 5508

IMPORTANT INFO:
---------------------
This project works best in the p5.js web editor, but any will work so long as you have p5.play added to your editor. The file using Classes currently does not work, please play the one listed with "(No Classes, Works)" to see the completed game and code that doesn't use classes. The one with classes is the exact same game except, well, it doesn't work properly. Please base performance/game running/overall idea on the no classes version.

CONTROLS:
----------------------
Left Arrow: Go Left;
Right Arrow: Go Right;
Up Arrow: Jump;


DIRECTIONS:
---------------------
Collect the keys through the level, and avoid the skull guards. Once you have collected a key, go to the door. You cannot pass through this door without a key. Going through the door takes you to the next level. Make it through three levels to win!


STORY:
---------------------
You have been thrown into the town's dungeon after false acustations. Luckily for you, the guards aren't that great at keeping their keys with them, so you can collect them and escape on your own. Can you make it out alive?

KNOWN ISSUES:
---------------------
Classes are not included because I could not get them to work in time for submission, and I wanted to present a working project. Unfortunately, this is due trying to make a working project without classes and then translate it over into a project with classes, which took a lot longer than expected.
